1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
   * The concept of Pushing to a remote repository. I Was not certain if the local branch pushed remotely or if you were creating a new branch remotely with the described name

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    * The push concept was very much clarified. Also the actions of 2 separate people using the same GitHub project was greatly clarified. The owner vs assignee features, while not directly addressed, came up after our first pull request and merge and helped me to understand merge procedure.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    * The concept of `git push` and what makes a good comment during a commit/merge
    * The idea of fetch and merge was difficult to grasp and we discussed with my pair and the guide

4. What still confuses you about Git?
    * Why and how a conflict occurs in merging in a nuanced way. As per how line# or blank spaces create merge conflicts. We both agreed to work on creating conflicts independently to gain a better grasp on merge conflicts

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    * It was a little bit stressful. I believe this was the first pairing for both of us and not just the first GPS. Because of that i think we both walked in with a little apprehension as to how to get started and how to keep the work moving forward. Simply organizing my workspace to Drive vs Navigate took longer for me than i expected it to and we likely killed a lot of time just getting comfortable with how the work would flow. Once we got in to the roles, and the definition of driver/navigator seemed better defined, the challenge had us switch which caused me to have to reconfigure. 
    * My pair was very nice to work with. He was very clear as to what the challenge asked us to do for every step and was quick to find any syntax questions. As we both learned, a discussion of time management at the start of a pairing session may be helpful to keep us on tasks relevant to the challenge.
