What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  I wasn't very clear on merging after pulling in changes from a remote branch. It seemed like as I fetched the changes they should automatically be merged if there was no conflict, but that isn't the way it worked.
What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  The above about fetching and merging. Also when pushing I learned that you're always pushing the branch you're in (or all branches) to a branch of the same name (unless specified) on the remote.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  Usually questions about syntax are what came up. Things like not needing quotation marks around branch names. Also we asked questions about the two concepts mentioned above. Additionally, we asked questions about `git diff` to each other and tested our ideas when we weren't sure.
What still confuses you about Git?
  One thing we still weren't sure of is how git knows when a line inside a file is changed. Our two hypotheses were line numbers and some sort of matching algorithm, but we didn't get clarity. I think we both plan to do some testing to get a better sense this week.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  The first pairing experience was nice. I don't think either of us really knew what to expect, but my partner was kind as we figured out how to do the respective driver and navigator roles. We were a bit slow, and could probably stand to manage time better as we do it.
